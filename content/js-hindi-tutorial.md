# Introduction of JavaScript

JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, and interpreted programming language. It is primarily used for client-side scripting on the web, allowing developers to create interactive web pages. JavaScript is also popular for developing desktop and mobile applications, as well as for server-side programming.

## History of JavaScript

JavaScript was first introduced in 1995 by Brendan Eich, a programmer at Netscape Communications. It was initially called "Mocha", but was later renamed to JavaScript. The language was designed to be used for adding interactivity to web pages, and was first used in the Netscape Navigator web browser.

## Features of JavaScript

JavaScript is a versatile language that has many features that make it popular among developers. Some of the key features of JavaScript include:

### Dynamic Typing

JavaScript is dynamically typed, which means that the data type of a variable is determined at runtime rather than at compile time.

### First-Class Functions

JavaScript functions are first-class functions, which means that they can be passed as arguments to other functions, returned as values from functions, and stored in data structures.

### Prototype-Based Object-Oriented Programming

JavaScript is a prototype-based language, which means that objects can inherit properties and behavior from other objects.

### Built-in Support for Arrays and Objects

JavaScript has built-in support for arrays and objects, which makes it easy to work with data in the language.

### Support for Regular Expressions

JavaScript has built-in support for regular expressions, which makes it easy to work with text data.

### Support for Events

JavaScript has built-in support for events, which makes it easy to add interactivity to web pages.

## Basic Syntax of JavaScript

The basic syntax of JavaScript is similar to other C-like languages. A JavaScript program consists of a series of statements, which are executed in order.
### Sum of Two Numbers

The following code calculates the sum of two numbers:
let num1 = 10;
let num2 = 20;
let sum = num1 + num2;
console.log(sum);
### Variables in JavaScript

In JavaScript, a variable is a name given to a value. Variables are used to store and manipulate data in a program.

#### Declaring Variables

In JavaScript, variables are declared using the `let`, `const`, or `var` keywords.

The `let` keyword is used to declare a variable that can be reassigned a value.

Example:
