# Introduction to Next.js

Next.js is an open-source React front-end framework that enables server-side rendering and generates static web pages for production. It is built on top of React and provides a set of features out of the box such as server-side rendering, static site generation, code splitting, and more.

## Features of Next.js

1. **Server-side rendering**: Next.js allows you to render your React components on the server, which provides better SEO and faster page loads.
2. **Static site generation**: Next.js can generate static HTML files for your pages, which can be served directly by a web server without the need for a Node.js server.
3. **Code splitting**: Next.js allows you to split your code into smaller chunks, which can be loaded on demand, reducing the initial load time of your application.
4. **Built-in CSS support**: Next.js comes with built-in support for CSS, which means you don't need to set up a separate CSS build step.
5. **Internationalization and localization**: Next.js provides built-in support for internationalization and localization, which makes it easy to create applications that can be used by people all over the world.
6. **API routes**: Next.js provides a built-in way to create API routes, which makes it easy to create RESTful APIs.
7. **Support for TypeScript**: Next.js supports TypeScript, which makes it easy to catch errors early and improve code maintainability.

## Getting started with Next.js
